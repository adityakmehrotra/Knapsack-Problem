# Knapsack-Problem
Using java to solve the Knapsack Problem optimally in terms of time and space.

## Optimal Alogrithm for the Knapsack Problem

### Problem Description
The input will start with an positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. For each instance, there will two positive integers, representing the number of items and the capacity, followed by a list describing the items. For each item, there will be two nonnegative integers, representing the weight and value, respectively.

### Sample Input
2<br>
1 3<br>
4 100<br>
3 4<br>
1 2<br>
3 3<br>
2 4

### Sample Output
0<br>
6

### Sample Input and Output Description
The sample input has two instances. The first instance has one item and a capacity of 3. The item has weight 4 and value 100. The second instance has three items and a capacity of 4.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the optimal knapsack problem is **O(n * W)**, where n is the number of items and W is the capacity.
